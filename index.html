      <h2>Don Doraste Buntu</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Writer • Dreamer • Creator</p>

      <p>
        Hi there, my name is Don Doraste Buntu. I am from Burundi, Africa. I’m someone who loves creating — whether through words, images, or simple moments of inspiration. I’m not perfect, but I always strive to make things that feel beautiful and meaningful. When I’m writing or designing, I often drift into my own world — a dreamer at heart, bringing imagination to life in small, thoughtful ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not exactly a full-time writer, but I truly enjoy expressing myself and sharing my creativity with others. There’s something special about seeing your work touch people — to inspire, to bring joy, or to give them a bit of motivation when they need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is more than just a website for me — it’s my creative room, a place where I can learn, grow, and connect with others who appreciate art, words, and meaning. I hope my work encourages you, lifts you up, and reminds you that beauty can come from the simplest things. If my work resonates with you or sparks any thoughts, feel free to reach out to me via email — I’d love to hear from you.
      </p>
